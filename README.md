# Non-Linear_SVR
It is a much more complex process unlike the linear Support Vector Regression (SVR).

## Definition
> Non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of SVR that can model complex relationships between the input features and the target variable by using a kernel trick. Unlike linear SVR, which fits a straight or flat regression plane, non-linear SVR maps the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear regression can be performed, allowing it to handle non-linear relationships.

## Explaining how non-linear SVR works
### Kernel Trick:
> The kernel function transforms the input data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear relationship can be established.
> + Common kernels include:
> 1. Radial Basis Function (RBF): Handles non-linear patterns by measuring the distance between data points.
> 2. Polynomial Kernel: Fits polynomial relationships of varying degrees.
> 3. Sigmoid Kernel: Works like a neural network activation function.

### Non-linear Relationship:
> By using a non-linear kernel, the regression line in the original space becomes curved, capturing non-linear dependencies between input and output.

## Advantages of Non-linear SVR
> + Captures Complex Patterns: Effectively models non-linear relationships in data.
> + Flexibility: Adapts to different data distributions using appropriate kernel functions.

## Example Use Cases
> + Stock Price Prediction: Capturing non-linear trends in financial data.
> + Weather Forecasting: Modeling complex dependencies in climate variables.
> + Biological Data Analysis: Predicting outcomes in genomics or proteomics.

## Notes
> + Non-linear SVR uses kernel functions to model non-linear relationships.
> + Selecting the right kernel and tuning hyperparameters like 𝐶, ϵ, and kernel-specific parameters (e.g., γ for RBF) are crucial for performance.
Overfitting can be managed by appropriate regularization (𝐶) and kernel parameters.
